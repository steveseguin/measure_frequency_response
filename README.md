# measure_frequency_response
Used for creating a frequency response graph.  Supports calibration files.

This is a Google Colab document, so it's essentially Python in the cloud for free.

## to use
Play pinknoise into two microphones; preferably one with a flat response.

You can obtain pink noise from here: https://github.com/steveseguin/pink-noise-generator

Run the script and use the two audio samples
