# Measure Frequency Response
Used for creating a frequency response graph of a microphone, or the relative response between two mics.  Supports calibration files, such as those supplied by Dayton Audio (EMM-6, UMM-6, iMM-6 for example)

This is a Google Colab document, so it's essentially Python in the cloud for free.

## to use
Play pinknoise into two microphones; preferably one with a flat response.

You can obtain pink noise from here: https://github.com/steveseguin/pink-noise-generator

Run the script from Google Colab (Frequency_Response_analysis.ipynb) and use the two audio samples you recorded as inputs.
